# ProblemSolvingPattern
For TermProject code 

General Guideline

- You must write the first 4 problem solving steps in detail, plus the working source code (step 5).
- The overall structure of the entire program in terms of functions 
is very important.
- This is a team project.
- After defining the overall structure of the program, the team 
should assign different functions to different members of the 
team.
- Each team member should test and document his/her own 
functions.
- The team should put the pieces together, and do the testing of 
the entire program together, and update the documentation 
together.


Submission Guideline
- When submitting the project, each team member must sign 
off on percentage contribution and the work done.
- The submission should include the problem solving step 
writeup, source code, result screen capture, and the 
individual contributions signoff â€“ all in a single ZIP file. 
- The results have to be reproduceable by a Test PC.
- Never manipulate the result, otherwise you will get ZERO point
